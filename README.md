news**CHOMP** is a django app that condenses news for you. llm inference is used for the summaries, and my amateur scraping skills and curation bias means this is not really a reliable news source. its more a form of disposable news entertainment with the pleasant side effect of staying informed (another ai slop ap, if you will). there are minimal sources right now as i implement them one a time :)

current sources:  
*apnews*  
*bbc*  
*door county pulse*  
*urban milwaukee*  
*la taco*
