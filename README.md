news**CHOMP** is a django app that condenses news. llm inference is used for the article summaries - paired with my curation bias it's not a reliable source of current events. its more of a form of disposable news entertainment with the side effect of staying informed. there are minimal sources right now as i implement them one a time :)

current sources:  
*apnews*  
*bbc*  
*door county pulse*  
*urban milwaukee*  
*la taco*  
*st. louis magazine*  
*block club chicago*  
*the gothamist*
